## Children's Privacy

Garden Cards is rated PEGI 7 and is designed for general audiences. While the game is suitable for children, it is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13.

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at alexcodemaster@gmail.com, and we will delete such information from our systems.

**For Parents:**
Our third-party advertising partners (Unity Ads, AdMob, IronSource) are committed to COPPA compliance and provide age-appropriate ad experiences when they detect usage by children.

## Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of electronic storage or internet transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

Game data is stored locally on your device. We recommend using device security features (passcode, encryption) to protect your device.
